# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
<br>It was really helpful having to restate what methods were doing using the vocabulary we learned. It really helped solidify that for me. I'm most proud of those little aha moments when testing.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
<br>Methods can be reused and reran multiple times to avoid having to rewrite the same thing multiple times throughout.
